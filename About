Sonic the Hedgehog Protamedra is a visual recreation and rewrite project that aims to remake the classic era of the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. This project includes new story lines, new zones, new locations, and other new content that gives an alternate take on what Sega could have done with Sonic back in the day. This is fictional alternate history, and is not entirely realistic. In this alternate history, the Sega Genesis survived well into the very early 2000s via an add on that would combine the Sega CD with a more powerful version of the 32x hardware (similar to the power levels of the Sega Saturn or Playstation). This is actually not too unrealistic, considering the Playstation was manufactured well until 2004. Also there is a game released every year, with the time frame of the alternate history ranging from 1990 to 2004. A sequel project, Sonic Muroseivra, is in the works.
